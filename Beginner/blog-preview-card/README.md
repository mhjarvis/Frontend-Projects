## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. This was my first time using static fonts instead of importing from Google Fonts.

2. This was my first time hosting with Vercel, especially since the Netflify debaucle. I am still fairly new with using Webpack, and had some trouble originally getting images to load after uploading to Vercel. It appears that moving assets into the /dist folder has done the trick, but I'll need to dig into this further.
