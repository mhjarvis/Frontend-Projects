This is a solution to the [Planets fact site challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/planets-fact-site-gazqN8w_f).

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology"

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Astro (Web Framework)

### What I learned

- I need to better preplan the overall layout. For this project, I should have (for example), used Grid.
- This was my first project using Astro, which overall was a pleasure to work with.
- I need to name my classes better :|

### Continued development

I dont think I will fix anything at this time - though I know there is plenty of optimization that could be made.
